# My-KSP-KOS-scripts
These scripts are the ones I usually run or that I'm developing for everyday use. May update from time to time. Use at your Kerbals' own risk.

Version: KSP 1.9.1.2788

Mods: kOS: Scriptable Autopilot System 1.2.1.0 , kOS-StockCamera 0.2.0.0 , Kerbal Engineer Redux 1.1.9.0 , Module Manager 4.2.3 , Astrogator v0.10.2 , Trajectories v2.4.5.3 , Toolbar Controller 0.1.9.11 , Toolbar 1.8.0.5 , Click Through Blocker 0.1.10.15 , SpaceTux Library 0.0.8.6 , HyperEdit 1.5.8.0 and Kerbal Alarm Clock v3.13.0.0

As of yet this build is not very unstable and runs well, thanks to CKAN.

Credit where it's due, some fragments of the code have been inspired from multiple origins: KOS documentation examples, KSP forums, KSP videos in YouTube, r/KSP, r/kos, ChatGPT 3.5, etc.

Notes:
- There's not much difference in fuel saving between lto2 and lto3. Also, they may crash for no apparent reason. Also also, they need the utils folder and the script inside to run in any body, and yes, they should be able to get you to orbit from the surface of any body.
- In lto3 I'm trying to make it so it can launch you at any desired inclination from the ground. 
- Don't trust doHoverslam to do the surface burn in any place that's not the mun or minmus and out of a vertical freefall
